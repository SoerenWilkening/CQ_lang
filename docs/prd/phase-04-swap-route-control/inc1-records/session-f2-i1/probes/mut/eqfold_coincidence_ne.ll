; control_inplace_ry_reject_stateprep_eqfold_coincidence_ne.ll — DECLINE (F2,

; — an ALIAS of the quantum register muxed against a fresh rail, which no-cloning
; forbids (Rule 8). F1 forces seed == Pred incoming, so seed == k again, and F2's
; single test catches it with NO successor test at all. This fixture and its `eq`
; sibling are the pair that make the polarity-freeness a measurement rather than
; a claim: the arm is the FALSE successor here and the TRUE successor there.
; F2 — THE EQUALITY-FOLD AMBIGUITY (PRD §14.2b). `clang -O1` (IPSCCP with
; PredicateInfo) replaces every use of the condition handle by the literal `k` on
; the edge where `q == k` is a theorem — on BOTH edges of an `icmp eq`/`ne`
; diamond. The consequence, MEASURED: two programs CQ must decline arrive as a
; module BYTE-IDENTICAL to a genuine state prep whose seed is `k`. An Inc 4 that
; read the shape as state prep would turn TWO LOUD DECLINES INTO SILENCE — the
; class the Inc-2b clearance blocked on.
;
; THERE IS NO POLARITY CLAUSE, and that is a proof rather than a convenience (a
; polarity clause is exactly where bd `ogw2` put a wrong unitary): F2 asks the
; branch's predicate AND its inverse and declines if EITHER edge pins the
; condition's tainted operand to the seed's value, so there is no edge in the
; test to get backwards.
;
; ⚠ CORRECTED 2026-09-05 (round-1 Rule-13 review, lens L2 finding F-L2-5). This
; paragraph used to say "on an eq/ne diamond EXACTLY ONE successor is the edge on
; which the equality is a theorem, so there are exactly TWO physical readings,
; and given F1 both collapse to the single condition `seed == k`". The algebra was
; right and THE ENUMERATION WAS THE DEFECT: there is a THIRD reading (A3) in which
; an edge proves `H != k` and `H`'s own RANGE makes the surviving set a singleton
; whose value is NOT `k`. `int t = q & 1; int r = 1; if (t) r = cq_theta(t, θ);`
; is that reading, it is plain `clang -O1` C, and the literal test was silent on
; it BY DESIGN — a CONFIRMED silent miscompile at the Inc-4 hand-back. F2 is now
; RANGE-based on both edges; see
; `control_inplace_ry_reject_stateprep_range_mask1.ll`.
