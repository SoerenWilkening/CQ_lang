; control_inplace_ry_stateprep_i1_arm_flag.ll — ACCEPT.
;
; ⚠ THIS FILE WAS `control_inplace_ry_reject_stateprep_i1_arm_flag.ll`
; AND WAS A DECLINE UNTIL THE 2026-09-11 OWNER RULING. It is a `git mv`
; with the **IR BYTE-UNCHANGED** — only the RUN lines, the assertions and
; this header moved — so the module below is still, character for
; character, the one the four drbq Inc-4 adversarial rounds argued over.
;
;     _Bool r = true;  if (q == 5) r = cq_theta(true, .9);
;
; ---- WHY IT IS AN ACCEPT NOW (bd `drbq.14`; F2's `CondWire` narrowing)
;
; OWNER RULING 2026-09-11, verbatim: *"WE DO NOT WANT TO WRITE `int b1`.
; also WE DO NOT WANT ANOTHER cq function. it should just be an
; application of gates … I dont see the need for the over-decline."* The
; trade below was put to the owner plainly and was not vetoed.
;
; F2 no longer treats a pinned value that lies on the CONDITION'S OWN
; BACKWARD WIRE as a collider. The pin here was **%c (the branch's own compare
; result, an i1)**, found on the
; **arm edge**; it is in `CondWire` =
; `{Region.Condition} ∪ ⋃ railWireClosure(condProvenance(Region.Condition))`,
; the set built at the caller by calling R4's own helper.
;
; THE READING THE IR NOW GETS — the drbq Inc-4 state-prep stream, unchanged:
;   `i32 @cqrt_alloc_i1(i1 true)` at the hoisted theta (a FRESH rail,
;   carrying the SEED, never |0> unless the seed is), then one
;   `cqrt_ry_i1_controlled(f, %h1, 9.000000e-01)`, the ordinary flag
;   mint / `_unc` strip / free, and the prepped rail **FROZEN** — never
;   uncomputed and never freed, because a controlled gate's adjoint needs
;   its control and the flag is freed inside the region. The condition
;   register is not touched by the region at all.
;
; THE RIVAL IT SILENTLY ABSORBS (alpha reading): the source rotated the
; CONDITION'S OWN register IN PLACE — `cq_theta(<the pinned register>, θ)` —
; and `-O1` const-folded arg-0 to the literal on the edge where the equality
; is a theorem.
; ⚠ SAY IT IN THOSE WORDS: a program that was LOUDLY REFUSED before this
; ruling now receives the circuit for the OTHER reading, with no
; diagnostic. That is the trade, and it is disclosed rather than fenced —
; no fence exists, because after `-O1` the two sources are ONE module.
;
; WHAT MAKES IT ADMISSIBLE — the rival has no lowering to be robbed of.
; The UNFOLDED spelling of that same rival is `probes/alt/i1_arm_flag.ll` in
; this
; increment's scoping record (`inc1-records/session-f2-i1/`), and it
; DECLINES `condition data use neither escaped nor measured`
; — MEASURED 2026-09-11 **on the narrowed binary**, not merely on `main`,
; so the narrowing did not quietly open it.
; The theorem behind the ruling: `railWireClosure` inserts its seed BEFORE
; any gate, so `RotBase` is always in `BaseWireOrder`, so
; `RotBase in CondRails => R4 declines` for EVERY chained (register-arg-0)
; rotation arm. The only way past R4 is `StatePrep` — the folded case, where
; the register is no longer in the module at all. So the alternative reading
; is not merely unimplemented, it is UNREACHABLE while R4 stands. (In
; practice a fence EARLIER than R4 fires first — see the measured string
; above — which is SCOPE H-4 and is why the retirement trigger in
; `f2SeedPinnedByLiveRegister`'s header names R4 and 2c together.)
;
; ⚠ THE NARROWING IS THE **WIRE** AND NOTHING WIDER. A register that is
; NOT in the condition's backward cone still collides and still declines:
; `control_inplace_ry_reject_stateprep_range_forward_add.ll` (a FORWARD
; user of a cone member — the F-R1-1 class) and `..._sideways_sdiv.ll` (a
; SIBLING, reached by neither direction) are both untouched, as are all
; 21 of the class-B fixtures. `..._reject_stateprep_nonwire_still_collides.ll`
; is the minimal discriminator written for this ruling.
;
; ---- HISTORY — the header this file carried as a DECLINE, VERBATIM ----
; Kept rather than deleted: it is the measured record of why the fence
; existed, and the ruling changes the DISPOSITION, not the facts.
;
; control_inplace_ry_reject_stateprep_i1_arm_flag.ll — DECLINE, and this is the
; PLAIN-C-REACHABLE half of the `i1` story (round-3 Rule-13 fix).
;
; This module is the `-O1` image of, verbatim (`$S/fix3/q/z02_i1_flag_arm.c`):
;
;     int slice(void){ int q = cq_theta(3, 0.3);
;                      _Bool c = (q == 5);
;                      _Bool r = 1;
;                      if (c) r = cq_theta(c, 0.9);   /* IN-PLACE Ry on the
; FLAG */
;                      return (int) cq_measure(r) + (int) cq_measure(q); }
;
; `clang -O1` substitutes `true` for `c` inside the arm (the arm edge proves
; it),
; so what reaches the pass is `call i1 @cq_theta_i1(i1 true, …)` — a STATE PREP
; whose seed is the fold of the condition register. The `i1` seed and the `i32`
; compare literal have different types, so the shipped `K->getType() ==
; SeedI->getType()` gate skipped every clause of F2 and this ACCEPTED, minting a
; fresh `cqrt_alloc_i1(1)` where the source rotates the flag's own rail.
;
; The un-folded spelling of the same program declines LOUDLY AND DIFFERENTLY —
; `rotation arm shares the condition flag` (`q/z04_i1_arm_flag.c`, which keeps
; the flag live so the fold cannot happen) — which is the Inc-2b F-11 structure
; exactly: the class was reachable ONLY through the fold.
