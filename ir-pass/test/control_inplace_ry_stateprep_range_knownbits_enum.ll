; control_inplace_ry_stateprep_range_knownbits_enum.ll — ACCEPT.
;
; ⚠ THIS FILE WAS `control_inplace_ry_reject_stateprep_range_knownbits_enum.ll`
; AND WAS A DECLINE UNTIL THE 2026-09-11 OWNER RULING. It is a `git mv`
; with the **IR BYTE-UNCHANGED** — only the RUN lines, the assertions and
; this header moved — so the module below is still, character for
; character, the one the four drbq Inc-4 adversarial rounds argued over.
;
;     int t = q & 4;  int r = 4;  if (t) r = cq_theta(4, .9);
;
; ---- WHY IT IS AN ACCEPT NOW (bd `drbq.14`; F2's `CondWire` narrowing)
;
; OWNER RULING 2026-09-11, verbatim: *"WE DO NOT WANT TO WRITE `int b1`.
; also WE DO NOT WANT ANOTHER cq function. it should just be an
; application of gates … I dont see the need for the over-decline."* The
; trade below was put to the owner plainly and was not vetoed.
;
; F2 no longer treats a pinned value that lies on the CONDITION'S OWN
; BACKWARD WIRE as a collider. The pin here was **%t = and %q, 4**, found on the
; **arm edge**; it is in `CondWire` =
; `{Region.Condition} ∪ ⋃ railWireClosure(condProvenance(Region.Condition))`,
; the set built at the caller by calling R4's own helper.
;
; THE READING THE IR NOW GETS — the drbq Inc-4 state-prep stream, unchanged:
;   `i32 @cqrt_alloc_i32(i32 4)` at the hoisted theta (a FRESH rail,
;   carrying the SEED, never |0> unless the seed is), then one
;   `cqrt_ry_i32_controlled(f, %h1, 9.000000e-01)`, the ordinary flag
;   mint / `_unc` strip / free, and the prepped rail **FROZEN** — never
;   uncomputed and never freed, because a controlled gate's adjoint needs
;   its control and the flag is freed inside the region. The condition
;   register is not touched by the region at all.
;
; THE RIVAL IT SILENTLY ABSORBS (alpha reading): the source rotated the
; CONDITION'S OWN register IN PLACE — `cq_theta(<the pinned register>, θ)` —
; and `-O1` const-folded arg-0 to the literal on the edge where the equality
; is a theorem.
; ⚠ SAY IT IN THOSE WORDS: a program that was LOUDLY REFUSED before this
; ruling now receives the circuit for the OTHER reading, with no
; diagnostic. That is the trade, and it is disclosed rather than fenced —
; no fence exists, because after `-O1` the two sources are ONE module.
;
; WHAT MAKES IT ADMISSIBLE — the rival has no lowering to be robbed of.
; The UNFOLDED spelling of that same rival is
; `probes/alt/range_knownbits_enum.ll` in this
; increment's scoping record (`inc1-records/session-f2-i1/`), and it
; DECLINES `condition predates a non-diagonal gate`
; — MEASURED 2026-09-11 **on the narrowed binary**, not merely on `main`,
; so the narrowing did not quietly open it.
; The theorem behind the ruling: `railWireClosure` inserts its seed BEFORE
; any gate, so `RotBase` is always in `BaseWireOrder`, so
; `RotBase in CondRails => R4 declines` for EVERY chained (register-arg-0)
; rotation arm. The only way past R4 is `StatePrep` — the folded case, where
; the register is no longer in the module at all. So the alternative reading
; is not merely unimplemented, it is UNREACHABLE while R4 stands. (In
; practice a fence EARLIER than R4 fires first — see the measured string
; above — which is SCOPE H-4 and is why the retirement trigger in
; `f2SeedPinnedByLiveRegister`'s header names R4 and 2c together.)
;
; ⚠ THE NARROWING IS THE **WIRE** AND NOTHING WIDER. A register that is
; NOT in the condition's backward cone still collides and still declines:
; `control_inplace_ry_reject_stateprep_range_forward_add.ll` (a FORWARD
; user of a cone member — the F-R1-1 class) and `..._sideways_sdiv.ll` (a
; SIBLING, reached by neither direction) are both untouched, as are all
; 21 of the class-B fixtures. `..._reject_stateprep_nonwire_still_collides.ll`
; is the minimal discriminator written for this ruling.
;
; ---- HISTORY — the header this file carried as a DECLINE, VERBATIM ----
; Kept rather than deleted: it is the measured record of why the fence
; existed, and the ruling changes the DISPOSITION, not the facts.
;
; control_inplace_ry_reject_stateprep_range_knownbits_enum.ll — DECLINE, and it
; RETIRES A RECORDED OVER-ACCEPT (round-2 Rule-13 review, lens R1 finding
; F-R1-3), closed by the round-3 fix along the way.
;
; `%t = and %q, 4` has the exact value set `{0,4}`, which `ConstantRange` CANNOT
; represent: `fromKnownBits` answers the HULL `[0,5)`, so the `ne 0` edge gave
; `[1,5)` and never the true singleton `{4}`. The shipped fence therefore missed
; a genuine A3 pin one bit up from `..._range_mask1.ll`'s, and F-R1-3 recorded
; both the miss and its fix: "when `Known` leaves ≤ 8 bits unknown, ENUMERATE
; the ≤ 256 `Known`-consistent values and intersect with `Edge`". `f2Refine`
; does exactly that, on EVERY value the walk learns about, and the pin is found.
;
; ⚠ IT WAS NOT REACHABLE FROM PLAIN C AT THIS CLANG AND STILL IS NOT. IPSCCP's
; lattice is a `ConstantRange` too, so it fails to pin `and q,4` and performs NO
; fold — the two analyses failed TOGETHER, which is why F-R1-3 cost nothing
; while F-R1-1's class (where the fold SUCCEEDED and the question was asked of
; the wrong value) was a miscompile. The fence is now STRONGER than the folder
; that creates the ambiguity, which is the safe direction and removes the
; retirement trigger F-R1-3 left behind.
;
; BOUNDARY, both directions and both measured: `hb03` (`and q,5`, `ugt 4`,
; seed 5) and `hb04` (mask 1) DECLINED BEFORE this change and still do — the
; hull happened to be tight there, so the enumeration adds nothing;
; `control_inplace_ry_stateprep_cond_derived.ll` (`and q,6`, `eq 2`, seed 0)
; still ACCEPTS, because 5 unknown bits enumerate to a set that does not contain
; the seed. The enumeration only ever NARROWS, so it can only ever add declines.
