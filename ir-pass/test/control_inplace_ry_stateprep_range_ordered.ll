; control_inplace_ry_stateprep_range_ordered.ll — ACCEPT.
;
; ⚠ THIS FILE WAS `control_inplace_ry_reject_stateprep_range_ordered.ll`
; AND WAS A DECLINE UNTIL THE 2026-09-11 OWNER RULING. It is a `git mv`
; with the **IR BYTE-UNCHANGED** — only the RUN lines, the assertions and
; this header moved — so the module below is still, character for
; character, the one the four drbq Inc-4 adversarial rounds argued over.
;
;     int t = q & 3;  int r = 3;  if (t > 2) { r = 3; cq_theta(&r, .9); }
;
; ---- WHY IT IS AN ACCEPT NOW (bd `drbq.14`; F2's `CondWire` narrowing)
;
; OWNER RULING 2026-09-11, verbatim: *"WE DO NOT WANT TO WRITE `int b1`.
; also WE DO NOT WANT ANOTHER cq function. it should just be an
; application of gates … I dont see the need for the over-decline."* The
; trade below was put to the owner plainly and was not vetoed.
;
; F2 no longer treats a pinned value that lies on the CONDITION'S OWN
; BACKWARD WIRE as a collider. The pin here was **%t = and %q, 3**, found on the
; **arm edge**; it is in `CondWire` =
; `{Region.Condition} ∪ ⋃ railWireClosure(condProvenance(Region.Condition))`,
; the set built at the caller by calling R4's own helper.
;
; THE READING THE IR NOW GETS — the drbq Inc-4 state-prep stream, unchanged:
;   `i32 @cqrt_alloc_i32(i32 3)` at the hoisted theta (a FRESH rail,
;   carrying the SEED, never |0> unless the seed is), then one
;   `cqrt_ry_i32_controlled(f, %h1, 9.000000e-01)`, the ordinary flag
;   mint / `_unc` strip / free, and the prepped rail **FROZEN** — never
;   uncomputed and never freed, because a controlled gate's adjoint needs
;   its control and the flag is freed inside the region. The condition
;   register is not touched by the region at all.
;
; THE RIVAL IT SILENTLY ABSORBS (alpha reading): the source rotated the
; CONDITION'S OWN register IN PLACE — `cq_theta(&<the pinned register>, θ)` —
; and `-O1` const-folded arg-0 to the literal on the edge where the equality
; is a theorem.
; ⚠ SAY IT IN THOSE WORDS: a program that was LOUDLY REFUSED before this
; ruling now receives the circuit for the OTHER reading, with no
; diagnostic. That is the trade, and it is disclosed rather than fenced —
; no fence exists, because after `-O1` the two sources are ONE module.
;
; WHAT MAKES IT ADMISSIBLE — the rival has no lowering to be robbed of.
; The UNFOLDED spelling of that same rival is `probes/alt/range_ordered.ll` in
; this
; increment's scoping record (`inc1-records/session-f2-i1/`), and it
; DECLINES `condition predates a non-diagonal gate`
; — MEASURED 2026-09-11 **on the narrowed binary**, not merely on `main`,
; so the narrowing did not quietly open it.
; The theorem behind the ruling: `railWireClosure` inserts its seed BEFORE
; any gate, so `RotBase` is always in `BaseWireOrder`, so
; `RotBase in CondRails => R4 declines` for EVERY chained (register-arg-0)
; rotation arm. The only way past R4 is `StatePrep` — the folded case, where
; the register is no longer in the module at all. So the alternative reading
; is not merely unimplemented, it is UNREACHABLE while R4 stands. (In
; practice a fence EARLIER than R4 fires first — see the measured string
; above — which is SCOPE H-4 and is why the retirement trigger in
; `f2SeedPinnedByLiveRegister`'s header names R4 and 2c together.)
;
; ⚠ THE NARROWING IS THE **WIRE** AND NOTHING WIDER. A register that is
; NOT in the condition's backward cone still collides and still declines:
; `control_inplace_ry_reject_stateprep_range_forward_add.ll` (a FORWARD
; user of a cone member — the F-R1-1 class) and `..._sideways_sdiv.ll` (a
; SIBLING, reached by neither direction) are both untouched, as are all
; 21 of the class-B fixtures. `..._reject_stateprep_nonwire_still_collides.ll`
; is the minimal discriminator written for this ruling.
;
; ---- HISTORY — the header this file carried as a DECLINE, VERBATIM ----
; Kept rather than deleted: it is the measured record of why the fence
; existed, and the ruling changes the DISPOSITION, not the facts.
;
; control_inplace_ry_reject_stateprep_range_ordered.ll — DECLINE (F2, the RANGE
; clause under an ORDERED predicate). THIS FILE IS THE PIN FOR THE DROPPED
; `isEquality()` GATE (round-1 Rule-13 review, lens L2 finding F-L2-1's second
; half).
;
;     %t = and i32 %q, 3        ; range [0,4)
;     %c = icmp sgt i32 %t, 2   ; NOT an equality
;     arm: cq_theta(i32 3, .9)  ; seed 3
;
; The true edge is `[0,4) ∩ (> 2) = {3}` — a singleton, and it IS the seed, so
; the module is indistinguishable from `if (t > 2) { r = t; cq_theta(&r, .9); }`, an
; in-place Ry on the condition register (R4). The shipped Inc-4 F2 was gated on
; `IC->isEquality()` and would have been SILENT here.
;
; ⚠ THE OLD GATE PASSED ONLY BY ACCIDENT OF CANONICALIZATION. From plain C the
; ordered spellings L2 measured (`t > 2`, `t < 1`, `t >= 3`) reach the pass as
; `icmp eq` because instcombine rewrites a singleton-range ordered compare that
; way — MEASURED, not guaranteed, and a hand-written or differently-optimized
; module keeps the ordered form. `makeExactICmpRegion` handles every integer
; predicate, so there is no reason to ask only two of them.
;
; ONE-TOKEN CONTROL: `control_inplace_ry_stateprep_range_ordered_seed0.ll` is
; this module with the seed and the pred incoming changed from `3` to `0` — the
; SAME ordered compare, the SAME singleton edge — and it ACCEPTS. So this file
; pins the VALUE test inside the range clause, not the predicate.
