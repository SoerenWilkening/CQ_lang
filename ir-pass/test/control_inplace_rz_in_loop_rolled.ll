; control_inplace_rz_in_loop_rolled.ll — a tainted-condition phase arm INSIDE a
; classically-bounded loop, lowered ROLLED (bd test_C_libtooling-drbq Inc 2a over
; the bd 8h7d.5 in-loop path; control-in-place-PRD §12.2 lists the rolled loop in
; scope).
;
; `for (i = 0; i <= n; i++) if (q > 5) cq_phi(b);` — one physical register, one
; back edge, IR size independent of the trip count.
;
; WHAT IS PINNED: the rolled CFG survives (a back edge and ONE copy of the body),
; the register is the SAME handle across the whole loop, and every ancilla — just
; the flag — is minted, used, stripped and freed INSIDE the iteration, so nothing
; dirty crosses the back edge (Rule 6). The hand-unrolled twin's byte identity is
; checked at the e2e layer by the `cmp` twin gates and
; `tools/loop_twin_matrix.py`; this file is the IR-level pin.
;
; (History: pre-3qlq the arm was `q = cq_phi(q, b)` on the loop-carried rail.
; Inc 2a kept that gate ALIVE, hoisted into the pred and still in
; `taint.GateCalls` with the register at arg 0, so the round-2 rail fan-out guard
; counted it as a SECOND in-place mutator and rejected every rolled Grover
; (`kMsgRailFanout`); `LoopLowering::isHoistedRegionArmGate` was the repair.)
;
;
; 3qlq(prep_a2): the FileCheck assertions below were RE-DERIVED from this
; fixture's own output under the Inc-1 (register-free `void @cq_phi(double)`)
; binary.  The pre-Inc-1 pin — a `cqrt_rz_<W>` or `cqrt_rz_<W>_controlled` on
; the user's REGISTER — asserted the gate PRD §1 shows is the identity on the
; marked branch (`cqrt_rz_<W>` is TENSORED, so a routed W-bit Rz applies
; `(-1)^popcount(target)` and can never mark |0..0>).  The stream now pinned is
; the KICKBACK: the flag is minted into a |0> ancilla, the phase lands on the
; FLAG with an UNCONTROLLED `cqrt_rz_i1`, the ordinary compare `_unc` returns
; the flag to |0> on every branch, and the flag is freed.  The fixture's
; PURPOSE (its header above) is unchanged.
;
; ORIGINAL negatives REMOVED.  Each was MEASURED to fire on this fixture's
; own Inc-1 output, so keeping it would assert something false.  A `-NOT`
; that used to sit AFTER a positive of its prefix was WINDOWED to the text
; past that positive; re-measuring it whole-file is a strictly stronger
; question, and where the pattern is one of the counted ones the
; `-COUNT-n` + `-NOT` pair below pins `exactly n` — stronger than the
; window it replaces, not weaker.

The width complement above cannot cover it either: it requires `(` immediately after the width, and `cqrt_rz_i32_controlled(` has `_controlled` in between.
