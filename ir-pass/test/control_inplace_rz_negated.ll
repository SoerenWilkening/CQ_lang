; control_inplace_rz_negated.ll — the §6a Rz peephole on a NEGATED (false-successor)
; phase arm (bd test_C_libtooling-drbq Inc 2a). Rule 9 polarity.
;
; `clang -O1` routinely makes the gate arm the FALSE successor, so the gate must
; fire on ¬flag. Both spellings of "fires on ¬f" use the SAME self-inverse
; `cqrt_x(flag)` bracket the swap route used, so they cannot drift — what changes
; is HOW MANY. The route bracketed EACH of its two `cqrt_cswap`s and therefore
; carried FOUR `cqrt_x`; control-in-place brackets the arm's GATE RUN once and
; carries TWO. That is the ONE count besides the route itself that Inc 2a moves,
; and it is the reason PRD §9.2's literal "the cqrt_x brackets … unchanged" is
; true of a non-negated arm and false here; `tools/golden_multiset_audit.py`
; models the -2 explicitly rather than waiving it.
;
; THE PAIR IS WHAT THIS PINS. A stray SINGLE `cqrt_x` would leave the flag
; inverted when the strip recomputes `q > 5`, so the strip would XOR onto the
; complement and `cqrt_free` would reset a rail holding |1> — a hidden measurement
; of an ancilla entangled with q (Rules 6/8).
;
;
; 3qlq(prep_a2): the FileCheck assertions below were RE-DERIVED from this
; fixture's own output under the Inc-1 (register-free `void @cq_phi(double)`)
; binary.  The pre-Inc-1 pin — a `cqrt_rz_<W>` or `cqrt_rz_<W>_controlled` on
; the user's REGISTER — asserted the gate PRD §1 shows is the identity on the
; marked branch (`cqrt_rz_<W>` is TENSORED, so a routed W-bit Rz applies
; `(-1)^popcount(target)` and can never mark |0..0>).  The stream now pinned is
; the KICKBACK: the flag is minted into a |0> ancilla, the phase lands on the
; FLAG with an UNCONTROLLED `cqrt_rz_i1`, the ordinary compare `_unc` returns
; the flag to |0> on every branch, and the flag is freed.  The fixture's
; PURPOSE (its header above) is unchanged.
;
; ORIGINAL negatives REMOVED.  Each was MEASURED to fire on this fixture's
; own Inc-1 output, so keeping it would assert something false.  A `-NOT`
; that used to sit AFTER a positive of its prefix was WINDOWED to the text
; past that positive; re-measuring it whole-file is a strictly stronger
; question, and where the pattern is one of the counted ones the
; `-COUNT-n` + `-NOT` pair below pins `exactly n` — stronger than the
; window it replaces, not weaker.
;   * call void @cqrt_free   [superseded by the FCNT count]
;   * call void @cqrt_x(   [superseded by the XCNT count]
;
; NOTE — the header above still NAMES a retired symbol (`cqrt_rz_<W>`,
; `cqrt_cswap` or a `_controlled` twin).  That prose is kept DELIBERATELY:
; it is the fixture's PURPOSE and the record of what the pre-Inc-1 pass
; emitted here.  Read it as history; the stream this file now ASSERTS is
; the derived one below, and the two are meant to differ.
;
; 9 line(s) of prose that annotated the OLD CHECK block were removed with
; it — they described the pre-Inc-1 gate stream line by line.
