; control_phase_kickback_seq.ll — ACCEPT. TWO SEQUENTIAL kickback regions — the
; flagship Grover customer of PRD §1, in its smallest form:
;
;     if (q == 5) cq_phi(PI);        // oracle: mark |5>
;     q = cq_theta(q, -0.5);         // diffusion
;     if (q == 0) cq_phi(PI);        // reflect about |0>
;
; Region 2's `Pred` IS region 1's `MergeBB`, which `flattenRegion` splices into
; region 1's `Pred` and ERASES — the bd hcrg block-lifetime hazard. It is resolved
; by EMISSION ORDER (emit the LATER region first) and not by declining, and the
; `sequentialChainAlias` predicate that does the resolving had to be WIDENED to
; this Kind, because it was `BranchRegion`-only.
;
; ⚠ THE WIDENING RESTS ON A FACT THE CLASSIFIER HAS TO ASK EXPLICITLY. hcrg's
; STRUCTURAL LEMMA (an arm has one predecessor, a merge exactly two, so they are
; never the same block, and two distinct regions cannot share a merge) is read off
; `soleMergePhi`'s 2-incoming φ — and a kickback merge has NO φ to read it off.
; `classifyPhaseKickback` therefore asks `MergeBB->hasNPredecessors(2)` directly.
; MEASURED — without the widening this exact program declines `control flow`.

; ── Rule-13 ROUND-2 finding F-R2-1, the assertion repair ────────────────────
; Round 1 repaired three assertion families (the 8-width Rz negative, the
; `cqrt_x` negative, the `cqrt_free` count) in the corpus IT could see, and the
; merge brought in a set that had never been asked the same question. Measured by
; injection at `c4bd888`: `cqrt_rz_f80`/`f16` NOT CAUGHT in 18 accepts, an
; UNPAIRED `cqrt_x` (a wrong-branch phase) NOT CAUGHT in 21, an EXTRA
; `cqrt_free` (a hidden measurement, Rule 6) NOT CAUGHT in 20. Every accept in
; the branch now carries all three, and each is validated by injecting the line
; into this fixture's OWN output.

; The `cqrt_free` census. An EXTRA free is a hidden measurement (Rule 6).

; ── THE BRANCH-PHASE RECORD, COUNTED — Rule-13 round-2, the `g_drop_mark`
; injection. Round 1's F-L7-1 was a CONFIRMED miscompile in which the whole-DAG
; spine ADJOINTED a kickback gate and cancelled the user's phase exactly; the
; `!cq.branchphase` record on every emitted gate is what stops it. Dropping that
; record from one gate was CAUGHT by 15 of the 35 gate-bearing accepts and MISSED
; by 20 — including every P4 nest but one and every P5 switch but one. MDCNT
; counts the GATES and MDTAG the MARKED gates, in SEPARATE prefixes, and they
; must agree. (An unmarked gate BEFORE a marked one moves only MDCNT; a dropped
; mark moves only MDTAG; an extra marked gate after moves both — round-2 F-R2-11.)

;     this increment removes (PRD §1: it marks `(-1)^popcount(target)` and can

; F-L6-4 / F-L8-1 / F-L4-2. The shipped ABI has NINE Rz widths

; enumeration listed SIX: `f16` and `f80` were absent from ALL of these fixtures,
; so the block's own claim ("no TENSORED Rz at any width") was 6/8 true.
; MEASURED by injection into this file's own pass output: `cqrt_rz_i32` was
; caught, `cqrt_rz_i1` was caught by the count prefix, and `cqrt_rz_f80` /
; `cqrt_rz_f16` were NOT. The regex below is validated in BOTH directions —
; it fires on an injected `cqrt_rz_i16` and does NOT fire on the clean output's
; `cqrt_rz_i1`, which is the one case a bare prefix test gets wrong (`cqrt_rz_i1`
; is a textual prefix of `cqrt_rz_i16`), so the trailing `(` is load-bearing.
