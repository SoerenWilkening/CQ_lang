; control_phase_kickback_two_calls.ll — ACCEPT. N GATES IN ONE ARM
; (orchestrator decision 2026-09-05, on the prep-b measurement OQ-5; PRD §6.3's
; first decline row is SUPERSEDED).
;
; PRD §6.3 refuses "an arm with N>1 `cq_phi` calls" on the ground that "summing
; angles is the 2b rounding class again". THAT GROUND IS A Ry-STEM GROUND AND IT
; DOES NOT SURVIVE THE SURFACE CHANGE. The 2b by-difference form realizes `A - B`
; as a `double` the source never wrote, which is why its whole arm-value fence
; (undef / link-time constant / non-finite / the 2^-40 rounding bound / the
; clearance narrowing to constant arms) exists. A KICKBACK SUMS NOTHING: N gates
; on the SAME minted flag are N `cqrt_rz_i1(f, θ_i)` in source order, each angle
; passed through VERBATIM, and `P(θ₁)·P(θ₂) = P(θ₁+θ₂)` on the branch happens in
; the hardware — not in this compiler. There is no `fsub`, no residual, no bound.
;
; Refusing them would also have regressed FOUR shipped e2e accepts
; (`slice_control_phase_diamond`, `slice_control_cond_datause`,
; `slice_control_switch_eqfold`, `slice_control_phase_ifelse_derived`) — all four
; on their REWRITTEN, register-free spellings, which land with branch
; `3qlq-inc1-slices` (prep-b). The copies committed here are the old-surface ones
; and do not compile against this branch's `CQ.h` (Rule-13 round-2 F-R2-4).
;
; ONE mint, ONE strip, ONE free — the arm's gate count does not multiply ancillas.

; ── Rule-13 ROUND-2 finding F-R2-1, the assertion repair ────────────────────
; Round 1 repaired three assertion families (the 8-width Rz negative, the
; `cqrt_x` negative, the `cqrt_free` count) in the corpus IT could see, and the
; merge brought in a set that had never been asked the same question. Measured by
; injection at `c4bd888`: `cqrt_rz_f80`/`f16` NOT CAUGHT in 18 accepts, an
; UNPAIRED `cqrt_x` (a wrong-branch phase) NOT CAUGHT in 21, an EXTRA
; `cqrt_free` (a hidden measurement, Rule 6) NOT CAUGHT in 20. Every accept in
; the branch now carries all three, and each is validated by injecting the line
; into this fixture's OWN output.

; The `cqrt_free` census. An EXTRA free is a hidden measurement (Rule 6).

; ── THE BRANCH-PHASE RECORD, COUNTED — Rule-13 round-2, the `g_drop_mark`
; injection. Round 1's F-L7-1 was a CONFIRMED miscompile in which the whole-DAG
; spine ADJOINTED a kickback gate and cancelled the user's phase exactly; the
; `!cq.branchphase` record on every emitted gate is what stops it. Dropping that
; record from one gate was CAUGHT by 15 of the 35 gate-bearing accepts and MISSED
; by 20 — including every P4 nest but one and every P5 switch but one. MDCNT
; counts the GATES and MDTAG the MARKED gates, in SEPARATE prefixes, and they
; must agree. (An unmarked gate BEFORE a marked one moves only MDCNT; a dropped
; mark moves only MDTAG; an extra marked gate after moves both — round-2 F-R2-11.)

; MEASURED by injection into this file's own pass output: `cqrt_rz_i32` was
; caught, `cqrt_rz_i1` was caught by the count prefix, and `cqrt_rz_f80` /

; it fires on an injected `cqrt_rz_i16` and does NOT fire on the clean output's
; `cqrt_rz_i1`, which is the one case a bare prefix test gets wrong (`cqrt_rz_i1`
