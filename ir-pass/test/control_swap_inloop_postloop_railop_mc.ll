; control_swap_inloop_postloop_railop_mc.ll — ACCEPT ×2 (bd
; test_C_libtooling-8h7d.5, Rule-13 ROUND 3, bookkeeping item 4). THE CROSS-FILE
; DEPENDENCY BETWEEN THE LOOP RAIL FENCE AND M-C's G6/G7 PAIR, FROM BOTH SIDES.
;
; `LoopLowering::collectRailGates` extends a loop rail forward to decide which
; gates can stale a rail record, and it deliberately does NOT follow an OFF-CHAIN
; in-place `add`/`xor` — otherwise it would refuse `mark = q; q = q + 9;
; measure(mark)`, which is correct today because that add lands on a FRESH rail
; (control_swap_inloop_postloop_railop.ll). Until this round the stated ground for
; the exclusion was that such an add "is lowered OUT of place by the M-C decision",
; as if unconditionally. THAT IS FALSE, and this file is the measurement:
;
;   @mc_plain      — `int r = q + 9; return cq_measure(r);` with NO later read of
;                    `q`. M-C (`classifyInPlaceReassignment`, ArithLowering.cpp)
;                    FIRES: the add is emitted IN PLACE as `cqrt_addc_i32(.., 9)`
;                    on the very register the loop rail owns.
;   @mc_then_theta — the same add with `q` still measured afterwards. M-C's
;                    position-aware deadness loop (G6, G7) REFUSES, and the add
;                    falls back to the out-of-place `cq_template_add_i32_hl` on
;                    a fresh rail, so the later `cqrt_measure_i32` of the
;                    register reads the pre-add value.
;
; The exclusion is therefore sound not because M-C never fires in place, but
; because M-C refuses in exactly the case a later record read exists; the
; dependency is written down at both ends (`collectRailGates` in
; LoopLowering.cpp and the G6/G7 site in ArithLowering.cpp), and LoopLowering's
; note records how weakly this file pins it (only relaxing BOTH G6 and G7
; reddens it). (These lines were cut by the 3qlq prep_a2 rewrite; restored
; 2026-10-05 against the CHECK block below.)
;
; 3qlq(prep_a2): the FileCheck assertions below were RE-DERIVED from this
; fixture's own output under the Inc-1 (register-free `void @cq_phi(double)`)
; binary.  The pre-Inc-1 pin — a `cqrt_rz_<W>` or `cqrt_rz_<W>_controlled` on
; the user's REGISTER — asserted the gate PRD §1 shows is the identity on the
; marked branch (`cqrt_rz_<W>` is TENSORED, so a routed W-bit Rz applies
; `(-1)^popcount(target)` and can never mark |0..0>).  The stream now pinned is
; the KICKBACK: the flag is minted into a |0> ancilla, the phase lands on the
; FLAG with an UNCONTROLLED `cqrt_rz_i1`, the ordinary compare `_unc` returns
; the flag to |0> on every branch, and the flag is freed.  The fixture's
; PURPOSE (its header above) is unchanged.
;
; ORIGINAL negatives REMOVED.  Each was MEASURED to fire on this fixture's
; own Inc-1 output, so keeping it would assert something false.  A `-NOT`
; that used to sit AFTER a positive of its prefix was WINDOWED to the text
; past that positive; re-measuring it whole-file is a strictly stronger
; question, and where the pattern is one of the counted ones the
; `-COUNT-n` + `-NOT` pair below pins `exactly n` — stronger than the
; window it replaces, not weaker.
