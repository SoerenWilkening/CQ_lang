; control_swap_inloop_seq.ll — ACCEPT (bd test_C_libtooling-8h7d.5, Phase 7.3
; Increment 3). A SEQUENTIAL PAIR of tainted-condition phase regions inside one
; classically-bounded loop body — the shape the customer program is written in
; (an oracle and a reflection, per trip).
;
; THIS FILE WAS `control_swap_reject_seq_in_loop.ll` UNTIL 2026-08-29 and its
; original job survives the flip: it is still the ONLY fixture that drives the
; sequential pair through the DIAMOND/IFELSE dispatch arm (bd hcrg moved it there
; from the NESTED arm), and it is still the only one that exercises the bd hcrg
; EMISSION ORDER inside a loop — region 2 must be emitted BEFORE region 1,
; because region 1's flatten erases the block (`%m1`) that region 2 names as its
; `Pred`. Both facts are now checked positively rather than through a decline.
;
; The block-lifetime hazard and the d8jl loop hazard were always DIFFERENT
; problems wearing one message, and this fixture is where that shows: ordering
; resolves the first (`lowerControlRegions`' precedence graph), and
; `flattenRegion`'s `replaceSuccessorsPhiUsesWith` repairs the second. Emission
; ORDER is invisible in the output because each emitter inserts positionally into
; its own pred block, so the gate stream is still source order — region 1's flag
; first.
;
; SINCE bd test_C_libtooling-drbq Increment 2a the flat phase arm lowers
; CONTROL-IN-PLACE (§6a): the arm's `Rz` is ONE
; `cqrt_rz_i32_controlled(flag, register, theta)` and the swap route (work-rail
; alloc, both `cqrt_cswap`s, the rail free) is gone. Nothing else moves — the flag
; mint, the strip, the flag free and every downstream gate are unchanged.
;
;
; 3qlq(prep_a2): the FileCheck assertions below were RE-DERIVED from this
; fixture's own output under the Inc-1 (register-free `void @cq_phi(double)`)
; binary.  The pre-Inc-1 pin — a `cqrt_rz_<W>` or `cqrt_rz_<W>_controlled` on
; the user's REGISTER — asserted the gate PRD §1 shows is the identity on the
; marked branch (`cqrt_rz_<W>` is TENSORED, so a routed W-bit Rz applies
; `(-1)^popcount(target)` and can never mark |0..0>).  The stream now pinned is
; the KICKBACK: the flag is minted into a |0> ancilla, the phase lands on the
; FLAG with an UNCONTROLLED `cqrt_rz_i1`, the ordinary compare `_unc` returns
; the flag to |0> on every branch, and the flag is freed.  The fixture's
; PURPOSE (its header above) is unchanged.
;
; NOTE — the header above still NAMES a retired symbol (`cqrt_rz_<W>`,
; `cqrt_cswap` or a `_controlled` twin).  That prose is kept DELIBERATELY:
; it is the fixture's PURPOSE and the record of what the pre-Inc-1 pass
; emitted here.  Read it as history; the stream this file now ASSERTS is
; the derived one below, and the two are meant to differ.
;
; 6 line(s) of prose that annotated the OLD CHECK block were removed with
; it — they described the pre-Inc-1 gate stream line by line.

; THE EMITTED STREAM, IN ORDER — DERIVED from this fixture's own pass output
; (prep_a2, bd test_C_libtooling-3qlq Inc 1).  Every `%name` below is bound at
; its DEFINITION and referenced afterwards, so the chain asserts operand
; IDENTITY — the strip and the free name the SAME flag the mint produced
; (bd 8txa: the golden itself must witness the pairing).  Handle names are
; DERIVED, never typed (bd drbq Inc 4: 9 of 20 accepts named a %h1 the pass
; never emits).  Trailing `!cq.branchphase` metadata is stripped here because
; its NUMBER is LLVM's, not ours; its presence and count are MDCNT's job.
