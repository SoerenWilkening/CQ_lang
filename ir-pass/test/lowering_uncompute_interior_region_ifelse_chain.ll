; lowering_uncompute_interior_region_ifelse_chain.ll — ACCEPT (M-B Increment 6,
; clause (d2)). THE FOUR-MEMBER ROUTE GROUP: an IF/ELSE phase region routes the
; base TWICE (once per arm, the else arm X-bracketed on ¬flag), so the recorded
; `RestoringRoute` has FOUR `cqrt_cswap` members and the discharge is legal only
; if ALL FOUR lie inside the interval.
;
;     q = cq_theta(u, 0.5);
;     if (((q * 37) >> 3) == 5) r = cq_phi(q, PI);
;     else                      r = cq_phi(cq_phi(q, 0.25), 0.75);
;     return cq_measure(r);
;
; WHY THE GROUP IS STILL THE IDENTITY ON THE BASE'S LABEL. The true arm's pair
; fires on `flag`, the else arm's on `¬flag` (the `cqrt_x` brackets are on the
; FLAG rail, opened and closed by `emitRoute` in the same step). At most one of
; the two exchanges is active on any branch, so the four calls commute and each
; active pair is its own inverse: the base leaves the region with the label it
; entered with. Two `Rz` gates run in between, both DIAGONAL and both on WORK
; RAILS, never on the base.
;
; THE ELSE ARM CARRIES TWO GATES DELIBERATELY. Written with one gate per arm,
; `clang -O1` merges the two `cq_phi` calls and muxes their ANGLES through a
; phi — a rotation angle under quantum control, which declines (Rule 3). Two
; gates in one arm keeps the two spines distinct. (The angle mux decline is not
; what this fixture is about; it is why the shape is spelled this way.)
;
;
; 3qlq(prep_a2): the FileCheck assertions below were RE-DERIVED from this
; fixture's own output under the Inc-1 (register-free `void @cq_phi(double)`)
; binary.  The pre-Inc-1 pin — a `cqrt_rz_<W>` or `cqrt_rz_<W>_controlled` on
; the user's REGISTER — asserted the gate PRD §1 shows is the identity on the
; marked branch (`cqrt_rz_<W>` is TENSORED, so a routed W-bit Rz applies
; `(-1)^popcount(target)` and can never mark |0..0>).  The stream now pinned is
; the KICKBACK: the flag is minted into a |0> ancilla, the phase lands on the
; FLAG with an UNCONTROLLED `cqrt_rz_i1`, the ordinary compare `_unc` returns
; the flag to |0> on every branch, and the flag is freed.  The fixture's
; PURPOSE (its header above) is unchanged.
;
; NOTE — the header above still NAMES a retired symbol (`cqrt_rz_<W>`,
; `cqrt_cswap` or a `_controlled` twin).  That prose is kept DELIBERATELY:
; it is the fixture's PURPOSE and the record of what the pre-Inc-1 pass
; emitted here.  Read it as history; the stream this file now ASSERTS is
; the derived one below, and the two are meant to differ.
;
; 13 line(s) of prose that annotated the OLD CHECK block were removed with
; it — they described the pre-Inc-1 gate stream line by line.

; (prep_a2, bd test_C_libtooling-3qlq Inc 1).  Every `%name` below is bound at
; its DEFINITION and referenced afterwards, so the chain asserts operand
; IDENTITY — the strip and the free name the SAME flag the mint produced
; (bd 8txa: the golden itself must witness the pairing).  Handle names are
; DERIVED, never typed (bd drbq Inc 4: 9 of 20 accepts named a %h1 the pass
; never emits).  Trailing `!cq.branchphase` metadata is stripped here because
; its NUMBER is LLVM's, not ours; its presence and count are MDCNT's job.
